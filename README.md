# Model View Controller Server Demonstration

<p>This project demonstrates the MVC framework approach to large-scale server logic by expanding on my previous server project titled <a href="https://github.com/JordanWinslow/node-store-poc">"Node.js Ecommerce Content Management System"</a>.</p>

<p>All input/output data logic is located in the "Models" folder, all templating-engine logic is stored in the "Views" folder and all logic which combines the models with the views is located in the "Controllers" folder.</p>

<ul>
<li>asynchronous file read/write operations
<li>callback functions
<li>.JSON data storage and retrieval
<li>Node.js server architecture & event looping
<li>Express.js route management with middleware (.set, .use, .get, .post, .render, .redirect, .status, etc.)
<li>Dynamic page content utilizing user input to update page data
<li>Templating engines, specifically <b>ejs</b>
<li>Parsing and routing data
<li>Express router for multi-layer server paths
<li>Creation of utility/helper functions for path management
<li>Placeholder/Representative content to demonstrate minimal viable product implementation
</ul>

<p>Though this project utilizes basic CSS & HTML metadata, it is <b>NOT a demonstration of SEO, CSS or design knowledge and should not be treated as such.</b></p>
<p>For a demonstration of design knowledge, see the following repository: https://github.com/JordanWinslow/ModernWebDesignShowcase1</p>
