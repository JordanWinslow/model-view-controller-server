# model-view-controller-server

This project demonstrates the MVC framework approach to large-scale server logic. All input/output data logic is located in the "Models" folder, all templating-engine logic is stored in the "Views" folder and all logic which combines the models with the views is located in the "Controllers" folder.

This project also demonstrates <b>asynchronous file read/write operations</b> and utilizes <b>callback functions</b> to display live-updates on the Front-End.
